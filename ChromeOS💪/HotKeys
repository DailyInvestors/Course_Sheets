Important Notes for Bookworm Linux Hotkeys:
 üëÅÔ∏è Customization: Most Linux desktop environments allow you to extensively customize keyboard shortcuts. If a hotkey isn't working as expected, check your System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts (or similar path depending on your DE).
 üëÅÔ∏è Application-Specific: Many applications (e.g., Firefox, LibreOffice, GIMP) have their own internal hotkeys that operate independently of the desktop environment.
 üëÅÔ∏è Laptop Function Keys: On laptops, you might need to press the Fn key in combination with an F-key (e.g., Fn + F1 to F12) to get the standard F-key behavior, as the default action might be a media control or brightness setting.
