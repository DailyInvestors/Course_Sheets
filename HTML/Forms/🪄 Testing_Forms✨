Â°Â°MeasuringÂ°Â°
Â°Â° There are several ways I will talk about measuring. My preferred method for Everything is Dev Tools. Now some users may prefer Burp Suite, Requestly, etc to test. However in my opinion as a Specialist, Dev Tools and Mozillas Dev Tools are the best options for Testing.

1. PS1: PageSpeed Insights
â€¢â€¢ Reports using field data.
â€¢â€¢ We can use their API to build our own Monitoring Tool.
â€¢â€¢ Includes data from the Chrome User Experience.

2. Lighthouse
â€¢â€¢Identifies performance, SEO, best practice roles, and accessibility issues.
â€¢â€¢Basically a self-perforned Audit.
Â°Â° Can be command-line.
â€¢â€¢ Can be a Node Module
â€¢â€¢ Can be used with the Lighthouse-CI Tool.
â€¢â€¢ Can be ran with GitHub Actions and probably their AI as well.
