Large Blob Extension

Description: Both client registration and authentication extension allow a Relying Oarty to store opaque data associated with credentials. Most authenticators can only store small Bytes of Data, relying on Third Party ways to hold and Store. While some, Store all the Clients Data in your Storage.

#Example:
Do to storage issues, instead of storing in a secure place, the function will choose to create a certificate instead of following the proper process.


With this certificate system, the certificate needs to be signed over the Public üóùÔ∏è. This does not add a ability to write "Blobs" in yhe actual reg. Releying Parties should use the "registration extension" when creating.


#On a Security aspect for Defense. Chrome offers experiments that offer to Turn the Blob Settings off in seveal dif ways, including Linux.

1. largeBlob: Registration & Authentication 

partial dictionary AuthenticationExtensionsInputs {
  AuthenticationExtensionsLargeBlobInputs largeBlob;
};

enum LargeBlobSupport {
  "required",
  "preferred",
};

dictionary AuthenticationExtensionsLargeBlobInputs {
    DOMString support;
    boolean read;
    BufferSource write;
};


# Enumertions for this specification exist in the Document nation, and as the Registry.
# The Boolean indicates that the Relying Party would fetch the previously-written blob associated with the asserted credentials.


2. Client Extension Processing 
  1. If read and write are present.
    1. Return the DOMException whose name is "NotSupportError".
  2. If the supprt is Present.
    1. Set the support to "true", if the value is required.
    2. At times you may have [[Create]]() before any evaluating options.
    3. We can always use shebangs in this process to make what is true fale, or false true.


3. Client Extension Processing with
Authenication.
  1. If the support is Present.
     Return a DOMException whose name is "NotSupportedError".
  2. If read && write are present.
     Return DOMException whose name is "NotSupportedError".
  3. If read has the Value of true.
     1. Initialize the output and largeBlob.
     2. If successful, attempt to read all the Data associated with this credential.
     3. If write is true.
        1. And uf the returning DOMException whose name is "NotSupportError". Add in more error handling.
        2. If the injection operation is successful, attempt to store the contents of write on this authenticator.
        3. Set written to true or !==, ==!.

partial dictionary AuthenticationExtensionsClientOutputs {
  AuthenicationExtensionsLargeBlobOutputs largeBlob;
};

dictionary AuthenticationExtensionsLargeBlobInputs {
  boolean supported;
  ArrayBuffer blob;
  boolean written;
};




Defense: With using any JavaScript. For Security Purposes, it is hest to use as little as Possible. You dont need tons of code, for a single process or function. With javaScript, we can build any Function and or Process. With the History of javaScript and the past to where most of the Major 7, tried to say this procedure is irrelevant, their is still kuch of the Unknown of what javaScript can Really Do.
