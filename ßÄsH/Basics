A Basic Guide to Bash: 


Shells

 
How to change your default shell:
  Check current shell: echo $SHELL
 
View available shells: cat /etc/shells
 
 Change shell: chsh -s /path/to/new/shell (e.g., chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh). You'll need to log out and log back in for the change to take effect.

2. Aliases: BASIC
Where Aliases Live:
  ~/.bashrc: For interactive Bash shells (most common place for personal aliases).
 
 ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile: Often sourced by login shells. 

~/.bashrc is usually sourced from ~/.bash_profile for consistency.

  System-wide: /etc/bash.bashrc or files in /etc/profile.d/ (for aliases available to all users).
Key Considerations for Aliases:

Different Types of Aliases & Examples:

  Basic Shortcuts (Saving Keystrokes):
    alias ll='ls -lh' (long format, human-readable sizes)
   
 alias la='ls -A' (list all files, excluding . and ..)
   
 alias lsa='ls -lhA' (combination)
   
 alias cls='clear' (common from Windows/DOS)
   
 alias ..='cd ..'
   
 alias ...='cd ../..'
   
 alias c='clear'
   
 alias h='history'
   
 alias dfh='df -h' (disk free, human-readable)
 
 Safeguard Aliases: BASIC
   
 alias rm='rm -i' (interactive remove, prompts before deleting)
   
 alias mv='mv -i' (interactive move)
   
 alias cp='cp -i' (interactive copy)
   
 alias mkdir='mkdir -p' (create parent directories if they don't exist)
   
 alias chmod='chmod -c' (verbose output on changes)
 
 Command Combinations/Pipelines:
    
alias grepip='grep -i -r' (case-insensitive, recursive grep)
   
 alias psg='ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -i' (find processes, exclude the grep process itself)
   
 alias untar='tar -xvzf' (extract a gzipped tar archive)
   
 alias myip='curl ifconfig.me' (quickly get your external IP address)
   
 alias weather='curl wttr.in' (quick weather report)
   
 alias duhc='du -sh * | sort -rh' (disk usage human-readable, sort by size)
 
 Application-Specific Aliases (e.g., Git, Docker):
   
 Git:
     * alias gs='git status -sb' (short branch status)
     * alias ga='git add .'
     * alias gc='git commit -m'
     * alias gp='git push'
     * alias gl='git log --oneline --graph --decorate' (prettier log)
     * alias gcl='git clone'
   
 Docker:
     * alias dco='docker compose' (if using docker compose plugin)
     * alias dcup='docker compose up -d'
     * alias dlogs='docker compose logs -f'
     * alias dps='docker ps'
     * alias drmi='docker rmi $(docker images -q)' (remove all images - use with extreme caution!)
 
 Aliases with Arguments (a bit more advanced, often better as functions):
   
   ✓ Example (Better as a function, but showing the concept):
     
✓ alias mcd='mkdir $1 && cd $1'  {This is brittle, use a function instead() {

     Function (recommended for arguments):
     mcd() {
    mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}

     
✓.    This mcd function will create a directory and then change into it, handling spaces in names correctly.
Managing Aliases:
 
 Viewing All Aliases: Just type alias
 
 Viewing a Specific Alias: alias ll
 
 Removing an Alias: unalias ll (temporary until you reload your shell config)

Adding Aliases to your ~/.bashrc:
 1
 Open ~/.bashrc with your favorite text editor: nano ~/.bashrc or vim ~/.bashrc
 2. Add your alias lines (e.g., alias my_alias='my_command').
 3. Save the file.
 4. Apply changes without restarting: source ~/.bashrc


By using Alias in the correct formation, you can achieve a workflow that you never knew was Possible. While every Language has their strengths and weaknesses, BASH is BASH.
