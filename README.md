# Course_Sheets
This repo, will showcase off a variety of "Testing Techniques". Ranging from DOM, XSS, Python on how to test and defend against attacks, bugs, etc.
This is covered by the "Cyborg Tek": liscense, and is for educational purposes only.
These courses are for Profesional USE only, for employee and business training.
This basically same as everyone else. As this is my passion, and not to many people know anything. All we can do is give back, and teach people how to defend against all these attacks.
