This basically same as everyone else. As this is my passion, and not to many people know anything. All we can do is give back, and teach people how to defend against all these attacks.

And unlike alot of developers, my skills with These AIs, are on a entirely different level. Not by APIs, but by Prompts. Why people try to learn these, I have had them mastered since Day 1. They way I talk, text, write, and think. They listen,lol frfr.

Tip on everything: When im successful on anything its when I'm playing around. When im serious nothing, but goofing off, the Servers have No Limit lol
