Description: This repo is designed to help educate for Cyber Security Awareness. Bash is now in almost every single System, every Single Network, every Single Device. There is so much to it, that you will have to read several Books to sort of understand this language. Thwre are discrimancies about where this Language was truly Developed. Every book that I have read, is different then the next. One version is created on South Korea, which is the area I am focusing currently. The next in New Zealand or something like that, which I haven't fully gotten to yet. Here is a valuable list of resources to help educate you in whatever your Journey May Be.

Here is a list of references, at the end of all my Studies, I will ✍️ the Newest Bash Book. I am seeking Publication for creating these Books, if anyone does know someone on this area, I would appreciate any leads. I will one day create a Red Team Manual, A Book for Each Language. Advanced Books for Each Language. Several Linux Books, Several Google && Window Books, and Testing Guides such as the few that I have. However, my Teachings will be different then any other you will ever take. The labs I will design, will be nothing like the few out floating around. No lab attacks your system, no labs teach you how to evade. I will be the one that Takes my Country to the Next Level of Technology. Why because everything almost that everyone Teaches, is already blocked by the Students that went before you.
